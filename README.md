# INCA: Intelligent Concept Assistant

![img](images/inca-flow.png)

INCA is a [BD2K funded project](https://commonfund.nih.gov/bd2k/fundedresearch) to develop an
environment for helping scientists to collaboratively create, extend
and apply their knowledge to describe and interpret biomedical
datasets.

We are currently looking for web developers and machine learning experts - contact cjmungall@lbl.gov if you are interested.

To follow updates on the project once we get started, subscribe to [this ticket](https://github.com/INCATools/intelligent-concept-assistant/issues/1)
